            MusicReviewer Documentation

	MusicReviewer was implemented using the CS50 IDE. Similar to Finance, MusicReviewer uses Flask, Jinja, Javascript, Python, HTML, phpliteadmin, and CSS. We used the skeleton of Finance to format our website. To access the program, execute “flask run” and click on the link that appears.

	When you first arrive at the page, MusicReviewer will ask you to login to your account. If you do not have an account, click the three bars on the top right, click register, and register for an account. Otherwise, if you have an account, proceed with logging in.

	The first page you will see is “Feed.” Feed can also be accessed by clicking on the “Music Reviewer” icon. In Feed, you will see all of the music reviews that have been uploaded to the website. The reviews include: an album cover, album title, band name, the username of the user who reviewed the album, the user’s review of the album, and what time the review was posted. The reviews are presented chronologically, with the website’s most recent review being displayed at the top of the page.

	On the navigation bar on the top, you will be able to access other pages: “Add Review,” “Profile,” “Search,” and, in the top right corner, “Log Out.” You will be able to access these pages by clicking on the title of the page you want to access.

	“Add Review” allows the user currently logged in to add a review of an album to the website. To add a review, input the album’s title in “Album Title,” the album’s artist name in “Artist,” your rating of the album out of ten in “Rating out of 10,” your review of the album in the large “Review” box, and a picture of the album cover in “Choose File.” If one of these fields is incomplete, an error message will appear telling the user to redo their review. Once all of the fields are completed, click “Post.” An alert should appear telling the user that their review has been posted.

	“Profile” displays all of the reviews of the user currently logged in in chronological order. Profile is formatted similar to Feed: the reviews contain the same information and the formatting is the same.

	“Search” allows the user to search for other user’s profiles. In the grey boxes below the search bar, the names of all of the existing users are displayed. To search for another user’s profile, type their name into the “Search for usernames…” bar. Once the username of the person you wanted to search for appears, click on their username. This should redirect you to the searched person’s profile page, displaying all of their reviews.

    Finally, if you want to log out, click on the “Log Out” title in the top right corner. This should automatically log you out of MusicReviewer.
